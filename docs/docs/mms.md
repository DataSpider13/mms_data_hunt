## Quick Overview

MMS, a mission consisting of four identical spacecraft, was launched in 2015. The mission's spacecraft are organized in a tetehedron orbiting

around the Earth to study magnetic reconnection:

For more information regarding the theory of magnetic reconnection, please see [this article](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/science-of-magnetic-reconnection) for a introduction and [this article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2019.00070/full) for a more detailed description. But magnetic reconnection is not what we are attempting to find in this project.

## Bursty Bulk Flows (BBF)

Bursty bulk flows are high-speed plasma sheet events where the speed exceeds 400 km/s within a short duration (~10s). Here are some resources regarding this definition:
