## Quick Overview

MMS, a missions consisting of four identical spacecraft, was launched in 2015. This mission orbit around the Earth to study magnetic reconnection.

For more information regarding the theory of magnetic reconnection, please see [this](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/science-of-magnetic-reconnection) for a introduction and [this](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2019.00070/full) for a more detailed description. But magnetic reconnection is not what we are attempting to find in this project.
